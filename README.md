# LGMVIP - DataScience Internship

# Beginner Level Task

**Image to Pencil Sketch with Python:**

In this task of LGMVIP, I have converted my colored image to grayscale then inverted the grayscale image to get a negative and further by applying a gaussian blur to the negative and inverting it I got the final pencil sketch of my image.

# Intermediate Level Task

**1. Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm:**

In this task of LGMVIP, I have classified the Iris dataset with the help of Decision Tree Classifier algorithm and visulize it. Also, I used Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to identify the class of a Iris plant based on its features.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset 'Global Terrorism':**

In this task of LGMVIP, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset "Global Terrorism". As a security / defense analyst, I analyzed and found out some of the hot zones terrorism shared some extra beneficial insights by observation and visualization which is derived by EDA.
